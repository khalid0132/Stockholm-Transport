Yes, I tried to make my app secured by using firebase authentication (creating an user name and password but doesn't work properly, may be I mistake some where, so need to more exercise of that part)
I used login system by Google and Github that works perfectly, tried to use facebook but shows error, anyway...
I used private route for getting extra protection and redirected the expected route after login.
Changed my project name and used a bit in Swedish name,  need to more exercise on Material UI and React-bootstrap
Made a google map after searching on google, but route does not show
Used a very few fakedata for different riders and made destructuring as well as used Context API but need to more execise on that part too.
At last but not at least tried a bit to make responsive but does not work, I don't worry about that but need to more more and more exercise to make me as a perfect developer. Finally I am trying my best to get understading everying perfectly. 

Thanks in advance!!!
